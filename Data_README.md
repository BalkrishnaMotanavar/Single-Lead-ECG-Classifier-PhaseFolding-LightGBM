# Data

This project uses the PTB-XL dataset, available at [PhysioNet](https://physionet.org/content/ptb-xl/1.0.3/). Due to its size (~2 GB), it is not included in this repository.

To replicate the study:
1. Download PTB-XL from the link above.
2. Place it in your local directory (e.g., `/Users/your_username/datasets/PTB_XL`).
3. Update the `base_path` in the scripts to match your local path.
